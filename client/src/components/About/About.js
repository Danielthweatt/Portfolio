		<hr />
		<p>Life really is like a box of chocolates. You 
        never know what you're going to get! Or at least that 
        has been the case for me. Luckily, I enjoy 
        new challenges, new opportunities to grow and develop, 
        and so I keep loving life despite its twists 
        and turns.</p>
		<p>Case in point, I am currently learning how to code 
        and develop web pages; one of those life journeys 
        I never thought I would be on! I am loving every 
        second of it, though. Check out some of my projects, one 
        of which is this webpage, in my portfolio!</p>
